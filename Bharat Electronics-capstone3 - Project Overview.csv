,The Karnataka Retail Challenge: Deciphering Sales Trends at Bharat Electronics,,
,,,
Task,To decode the sales data for a week across six different stores situated throughout Karnataka and figure out how to enhance the sales performance,,
,,,
,Part 1) Understand how sales are distributed amongst the six stores and types of area as well as observe overall store efficiency,,
,,,
,Part 2) Understand which product and category has the most sales,,
,,,
,Part 3) Understand how sales are distributed across days of the week,,
,,,
,Data cleaning:,,
,1,"In the Stores tab, make sure the “Total area, sq.m” column contains only numeric integer values, no text components. ",
,,Standardise the column by converting the values to the right format.,
,2,"In the Products tab, make sure the “Category” column only contains the following text labels: Mobile Devices, Computers & Accessories, Home Entertainment, Home Appliances. ",
,,Standardise the column by converting the values to the right format.,
,3,"In the Products tab, make sure the “Price” column contains only numeric integer values, no text components. ",
,,Standardise the column by converting the values to the right format.,
,4,"In the Sales tab, make sure the “Date” column contains the dates standardised with the following conditions:",
,5,"Dates should range from March 6, 2023 to March 12, 2023 only",
,6,Dates should be in the format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2023-03-06),
,,Note: You need to manually type in the dates in the specified format in the respective cells that need to be altered.,
,7,"In the Sales tab, remove any duplicate rows.",
,8,"In the Sales tab, remove a row that is an outlier",
,,,
,Q1,How many rows (observations) are there in the sales data? Ignore the header row?,
,,464,
,Q2,"Now after the data cleaning tasks, how many rows (observations) are there in the sales data? Ignore the header row.",
,,459,
,,,
,,Additional data collection tasks:,
,A),"In the Stores tab, add a column for “City Population”. Search online for the populations for each location and add the values to this column.",
,B),"create another column called “City Type”. In this column, based on the population values, assign a text label to each city based on which group it belongs to:",
,,1,"If the population is above 5 million, then it is a bigger city."
,,2,"If the population is 500 thousand to 5 million, then it is a smaller city."
,,3,"Lastly, if the population is below 500 thousand, then it is a rural area."
,,,
,,Combining the three separate data tables into one:,
,,"If you notice, our Stores sheet has a “Store ID” column and our Products sheet has a “Product ID” column. ",
,,"But, our Sales sheet has both “Store ID” and “Product ID” information.",
,,By Using  VLOOKUP.,
,,1. Add a new sheet tab to your existing spreadsheet with three tabs and name it “Combined Data”.,
,,"2. Copy the first column of the Sales data and paste it into the Combined Data tab. Essentially, this column deals with Store ID information where sales were done.",
,,"3. Then, go to Stores data tab and copy the column headers (i.e. from B to F) and paste them into the Combined Data sheet",
,,"4. Now, you’d like to get the data corresponding to the Store name, Location, Total area, sq.m, City Population and City Type. ",
,,"5. Copy the remaining three columns of the Sales data and paste it into the Combined Data tab, to the right of the existing data columns i.e. Column G to I.",
,,"6. Lastly, we need the product-related information. In the Combined Data sheet, write the headers for Column J to L as: ",
,,"Product Name, Category, Price. Get the relevant information in these columns by looking up data from the ",
,,Products tab by matching the Product ID values in Column H of the Combined Data tab.,
,,,
,Step 5) Presentation of results + Step 6) Provide Recommendations,,
